    <p>
        Rose is a rose,
        and was always a rose.
        But the theory now goes
        that the apples a rose,
        and the pear is, and so is
        the plum, I suppose.
        The dear only knows
        what will next prove a rose.
        You, of course, are a rose-
        but were always a rose. <!--Body of Text-->
